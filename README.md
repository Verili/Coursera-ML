# Coursera-ML
As a beginner in Python and machine learning, I am attempting to impliment the code in the programming assignments for the course "Machine Learning" (available on Coursera) in Python as a means to practice both. The code is originally written in Octave/MATLAB. Criticisms of any form are welcome.
